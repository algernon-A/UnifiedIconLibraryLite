# Cities Skylines 2: Unified Icon Library

This is a mod that provides several collections of icons matching the game's UI style for modders to use in their mods.   This means that modders don't have to waste time finding or re-creating icons, or manually loading them into the game's UI.

This doesn't do anything unless you have a mod that uses it (such as Line Tool), in which case it's required.

Planned future functionality includes seamless UI style changing.

## Requirements
- BepInEx 5

## Installation
1. Make sure that BepInEx 5 is installed.
3. Place the `UinfiedIconLibraryLite` folder in the archive in your BepInEx `Plugins` folder.

### Modders

All icons are automatically pre-injected into the game's UI and are accessible via coui://uil/<StyleName>/<IconName>.  For more details, see the GitHub page.

The initial styles are Standard, Dark, and Colored.  More will be added later.

## Support
It's usually easiest to contact me at the **Cities: Skylines modding Discord** at https://discord.gg/ZaH2zjtk, or I'm also contactable as u/algernon_A on the Cities: Skylines modding Subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylinesModding.  You could also raise an issue on the GitHub.

## Meta

When official modding support (finally!) releases, this mod will also be published on Paradox Mods.

### Source code
Available on GitHub at github.com/algernon-A/UnifiedIconLibraryLite.

As always, *never* trust a mod without publicly available source code!

>And still be cautious about mods that *do* make their source available, but at least those mods are off to a better start by already treating you - the user - with at least a modicum of respect.

### Disclaimers and legal
The only authorized distribution platforms for this mod, or mods based substantially on the code of this mod, are the GitHub repo linked above, the Thunderstore.io upload, and Paradox Mods.  Any version or copy of this mod that you encounter elsewhere is most likely being used as a vector for malware and should be ignored.

Downloading, installation, and use of this mod is at your own risk.
