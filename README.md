# Cities Skylines 2: Unified Icon Library

## IMPORTANT: MUST BE INSTALLED MANUALLY
**Do NOT use the Thunderstore mod manager to install this mod!**
Only install this mod manually.  The Thunderstore mod manager, unfortunately, doesn't like mods like this and will mangle its format and make it not work.


## Description
This is a mod that provides several collections of icons matching the game's UI style for modders to use in their mods.   This means that modders don't have to waste time finding or re-creating icons, or manually loading them into the game's UI.

This doesn't do anything unless you have a mod that uses it, in which case it's required.

Planned future functionality includes seamless UI style changing.

## Requirements
- BepInEx 5

## Installation
1. Make sure that BepInEx 5 is installed.
2. Download this mod **manually** (**DO NOT USE THE THUNDERSTORE MOD MANAGER**)
3. Place the `UinfiedIconLibraryLite` folder in the archive in your BepInEx `Plugins` folder.

### Modders

All icons are automatically pre-injected into the game's UI and are accessible via coui://uil/<StyleName>/<IconName>.  For more details, see the GitHub page.

The initial styles are Standard, Dark, and Colored.  More will be added later.

To request new icons, contact Chameleon TBN on the [**Cities: Skylines modding Discord**](https://discord.gg/ZaH2zjtk).

As always, *never* trust a mod without publicly available source code!

>And still be cautious about mods that *do* make their source available, but at least those mods are off to a better start by already treating you - the user - with at least a modicum of respect.

### Disclaimers and legal
The only authorized distribution platforms for this mod, or mods based substantially on the code of this mod, are the GitHub repo linked above, the Thunderstore.io upload, and Paradox Mods.  Any version or copy of this mod that you encounter elsewhere is most likely being used as a vector for malware and should be ignored.
